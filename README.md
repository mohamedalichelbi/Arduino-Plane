# Arduino-Plane
transmitter and receiver program used to control arduino-based   3-channel rc plane 

data transmission assured with 2 rf24 modules (i used the ones with PCB antennas but code don't have to be changed for other antenna types except for power setting)

1 channel is used to control speed of brushless motor 

2 other channels used to control angles for 2 servos
